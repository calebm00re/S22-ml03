    "### Where did our data come from?\n",
    "* Our data came from the Open Powerlifting Databse. They are trying to create a database of powerlifting competitions for the public domain. The dataset that we are using here is a snapshot of what the database looked like as of April 2019. Powerlifting is a sport in which competitors compete to lift the most weight for their class in three separate barbell lifts: the Squat, Bench, and Deadlift. The dataset that we have here contains information about the competitors, the competitions, and the lifts that they performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What could we do with this data?\n",
    "* There is a lot of data that we can use here, but what we are more focused on is the prediction of the weight class of each person. If we can use data to predict with a very high accuracy what weight class a person should be in, it could be helpful in determining if someone is cheating or not. People could lie about their weight if there is not a weighing time. This could also show if someone is likely to be taking steroids. If they are classified as being far above the weight class than what they actually are, then investigators could look into the possiblity of them taking steroids.\n",
